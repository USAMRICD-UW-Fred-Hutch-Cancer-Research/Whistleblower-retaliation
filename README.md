From: Dr. Correo "Cory" Andrew Hofstad, Physician

Subject: Report of Product Failure, Systemic Negligence, and Mass Casualty Incident at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center

### 1\. Patient and Event Overview

-   **Patient Identifier:** Multiple staff and students (Over 60 fatalities reported).

-   **Date of Event:** October 9, 2023.

-   **Outcome:** Death, life-threatening injury, and disability.

-   **Location:** Weintraub Building, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (Fred Hutch).

### 2\. Product and Device Information

-   **Device Name:** MVE HEco™ Series Nitrogen Freezers.

-   **Manufacturer:** MVE Biological Solutions, Ball Ground, GA.

-   **Product Type:** Cryogenic life science freezers.

-   **Reported Problem:** Catastrophic nitrogen leak originating from partially constructed, unsealed freezer units.

### 3\. Description of Adverse Event

On October 9, 2023, a massive nitrogen leak occurred at Fred Hutch after an automated system pumped liquid nitrogen into incomplete freezer units. The following factors contributed to the severity of the incident:

-   **Detection:** Dr. Correo Hofstad detected the leak during a routine patrol and raised an immediate alarm.

-   **Management Failure:** The Medical Scientist Training Supervisor, Manoj Menon, reportedly dismissed the urgency of the report and allowed the nitrogen flow to continue.

-   **Environmental Impact:** As a heavy gas, the nitrogen poured into lower-level laboratories, displacing oxygen and creating a "death trap".

-   **Clinical Symptoms:** Exposed staff exhibited symptoms of nitrogen narcosis, including vertigo, auditory disturbances, profound disorientation, and irrational or violent behavior.

-   **Casualties:** The resulting asphyxiation led to the deaths of over sixty students and staff members.

### 4\. Systemic Negligence and Staffing Concerns

The failure is attributed to a broader pattern of institutional negligence regarding personnel and safety protocols:

-   **Impaired Personnel:** Reports indicate that engineering staff, including students from North Seattle College, were working under the influence of alcohol and narcotics following a party at "El Corazon".

-   **Technical Incompetence:** Staff reportedly lacked basic knowledge of gas physics, falsely believing nitrogen would harmlessly dissipate rather than settle in lower levels.

-   **Whistleblower Retaliation:** Dr. Hofstad was terminated from his position at Allied Universal Security within an hour of reporting the leak. Subsequent efforts to cover up the involvement of impaired NSC students led to his expulsion from Seattle Colleges in May 2025.

### 5\. Ongoing Risk to Viral Specimen Integrity

In addition to the life-safety event, systemic chemical ignorance is causing the degradation of vital research specimens at the University of Washington (UW):

-   **Chemical Misuse:** Researchers are utilizing vitrification solutions containing Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) without strict pH control.

-   **Detergent Effect:** When mishandled, these cryoprotectants act as detergents, dissolving the lipid envelopes and polysaccharide capsules of viral specimens.

-   **REDOX Reactions:** Mismanaged freezing processes are inducing REDOX reactions that destabilize viral capsid structures, leading to irretrievable loss of sample integrity.

### 6\. Recommendations and Call for Action

-   **Immediate Audit:** A thorough investigation into the conflict of interest involving Manoj Menon and the sale of nitrogen to external enterprises is required.

-   **OSHA Compliance:** The University of Washington must purge unqualified personnel and return to strict adherence to OSHA standards for HAZMAT and laboratory safety.

-   **Virtual Transitions:** High-containment (BSL-3/BSL-4) laboratory tours for untrained students should be transitioned to virtual formats to prevent further Laboratory-Acquired Infections (LAIs) or accidental pathogen releases.
